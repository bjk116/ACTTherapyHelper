it was completed.  This will functiont he same for routine lists
or daily todos like walking/reading/gutiar etc

For one off todos - user gets alert its time for errand X at
predetermined time by user.  User fills out thought log, and then 30 minutes later gets a checkup if they completed it.

These 30 minute later check ups can be delayed, but must eventually be answered as yes i did it or no im not doing it today. - Choice to push the todo to another date.
